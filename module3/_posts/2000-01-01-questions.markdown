# Check-In (10 minutes)

Last week’s assignment asked you to do some research into the issue that you care about and to write a few sentences answering the following questions: 
 
- What am I interested in writing that could begin to move the needle on the social issue that I care about?
- Who has already started to answer, engage with, and solve this question? In your own community? In other areas?
- What are possible sources—in-person experts to talk with, and print and other media resources—to help my exploration of what has worked and what hasn’t?

In one or two sentences, share a summary of what you wrote with the group in your facilitator guide! (This is great elevator pitch practice, by the way.)
