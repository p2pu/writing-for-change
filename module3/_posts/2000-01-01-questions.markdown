# What Should My Project / Artifact Be? 

Our previous weeks have focused on looking at the issues that are close to you, and doing some background research on who has covered your issue in the past. 

This week is about what kind of intervention you will make in order to enact social change. Will your project be:

- a manifesto
- a policy initative
- an opinion/editorial (op-ed)
- a non-profit organization
- an event
- a product
- a crowdfunding campaign
- a combination of the above?

This week you'll hear from an array of people who have enacted social change in a variety of ways: artists, designers, organizers, educators. 

We've asked them to hone in on *how* they decided what their artifact / intervention should be. How did they choose their medium or platform? 

They contributed essays specifically for this course, so we are very thankful :)

This week you'll be selecting your artifact, and creating a proposal for that artifact that you'll work towards during the rest of the course.
