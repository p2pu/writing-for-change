# Activity: What Will Your Artifact or Intervention Be?

Now that you’ve read several stories of “how”, it’s time to spell out what your artifact will be!  

- a manifesto
- a policy initiative
- an opinion/editorial (op-ed)
- a non-profit organization
- an event
- a product
- a crowdfunding campaign
- a combination of the above!

Take **five minutes** to free-write your answers to the following questions:
- Based on the essays that you’ve read, which type of artifact seems like the best fit for the kind of social change you want to write about?
- What most excites you about the possibility?
- What about this artifact feels intimidating or scary? What type of research do you need to do to move forward?

Take **20 minutes** to discuss your thoughts and share suggestions as a group. Save notes from your discussion in the facilitator guide.
