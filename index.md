# Welcome to Writing for Change

Writing for Change is a free 5-week course designed to help you create a writing group focused on advocating for change. This material can be used by anyone to facilitate a learning circle where participants will improve their writing, refine their purpose, and invite group critique.

Over the course of the next five weeks, the readings and activities in this course will help learners to:

- Identify your motivations and desired impact in facilitating change
- Collectively develop interventions that positively impact your communities
- Explore methods that invite iterative collaboration and generative criticism

In the first part of this course, learners will identify a social issue that matters to them--something that motivates them to enact change. This will prepare learners for the next part of the course where they will plan and write for change collectively.

## How do I create a learning circle?

You can create a learning circle on the [P2PU website](https://www.p2pu.org/en/), and you can make a copy of a P2PU facilitator guide to help structure your meetings:

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6Gsj76HWb0nu3z3QETGqD3g3gmSzWmUhG2zr01Nock/copy"><i class="fa fa-home"></i> Facilitator Guide: Writing for Change </a>

This facilitator guide is designed to be a **living document** that learners can use to keep track of their writing, add questions, and leave feedback for future learning circles.

You do not have to run the course exactly as outlined. Our content is a guideline for your own venture into the forays of facilitating a writing group focused on social change. This material is more effective when it can connect personally to learners, so we encourage you to customize the content based on your local area’s history, your personal intentions for running this program, and the learning goals of your attendees.

## How do I use this course?

This course is free to access and use however you see fit. However, the learning materials are structured to be run as a learning circle: a facilitated study group for people who want to meet regularly and learn about a topic with others. Facilitators should review each week’s content before each meeting, but they need not be content experts in order to facilitate: the videos, articles, and discussion prompts in this course are featured to encourage dialogue and open up opportunities to have more in-depth conversations about race and racism. For quick and easy access, all the links from this course are featured on this link tree, listed in chronological order of need for the course.

We hope the members of your cohort can support one another long after the conclusion of this learning circle. Here's to the future!
