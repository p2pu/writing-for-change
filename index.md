P2PU is a university for the web, built by an open community. Instead of lonely, anonymous online courses, our communities sustain interest and engagement because folks build them together. We are open and welcoming in everything we do, and help folks generally feel comfy on the internet. Our core values are openness, community and peer learning, and we've built learning communities with the likes of Creative Commons, Mozilla, NYU and MIT.

We're a friendly crew.
