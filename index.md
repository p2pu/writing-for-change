# Welcome to Writing for Change

Thanks for joining this learning circle! Over the course of the next five weeks, the readings and activities in this course will help you to:

- Identify your motivations and desired impact in facilitating change
- Collectively develop interventions that positively impact your communities
- Explore methods that invite iterative collaboration and generative criticism

In the first part of this course, youâ€™ll identify a social issue that matters to you--something that motivates you to enact change. This will prepare you for the next part of the course where you will plan and write for change collectively.

## The Facilitator Guide

We've made a facilitator guide that you and your group can use during this learning circle to keep track of your writing. This will be a **living document** that all of you can edit to save your assignments, add questions, and leave feedback for future learning circles. You can make a copy of our facilitator guide for your learning circle below:

We hope the members of your cohort can support one another long after the conclusion of this learning circle. Here's to the future!
