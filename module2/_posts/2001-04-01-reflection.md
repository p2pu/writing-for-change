## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Plus/Delta** – What went well today? What do you want to change for the next meeting? 
Use the facilitator guide to take notes of any suggestions you want to save.

### Before the Next Meeting

Next week, you'll select an artifact for the kind of social change that you want to write about. Your artifact could be:
- a manifesto
- a policy initative
- an opinion/editorial (op-ed)
- a non-profit organization
- an event
- a product
- a crowdfunding campaign
- a combination of the above!

To prepare, read the essays from the list below before next week's session. We asked a variety of artists, designers, organizers, educators how they have enacted social change - they contributed essays specifically for this course, so we are very thankful!

**Independent Assignment**
Next, do some research into the issue that you care about. Free-write a few sentences answering the following questions to share next week: 
- What am I interested in writing that could begin to move the needle on the social issue that I care about?
- Who has already started to answer, engage with, and solve this question? In your own community? In other areas?
- What are possible sources—in-person experts to talk with, and print and other media resources—to help my exploration of what has worked and what hasn’t?
