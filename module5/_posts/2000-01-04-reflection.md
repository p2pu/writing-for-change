# Reflection (5 minutes)

**Plus/Delta**
What went well today? What do you think future learning circles running this course should change?

## Looking towards the future:
 
Now that you have a vision for an artifact that you want to create and a cohort of writers who share your interests, we leave you with some examples of how communities have created artifacts together:
 
1. [Village Talk, Creating with Meaning](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/villagetalk)
2. [Act Up Oral History Project](http://www.actuporalhistory.org/index1.html)
3. [Chef Hangout](http://www.chefhangout.com/how-it-works)

We want to know how you co-create futures with the people in you community! Share your stories and your feedback on this course with thepeople [at] p2pu.org - weâ€™d love to share your insights with future facilitators running this learning circle!
