# Readings (35 minutes)

Use the facilitator guide to share links to your second draft with the group.

Then, take turns asking for feedback following the steps of the Critical Response Process. 
 
(Remember - you don’t need to go through all four steps! Each writer can pick and choose the steps that feel the most important to where they are in the writing process. For example, a writer who has specific questions to ask the group about their piece can say, “I’m looking for 2’s.” A writer who wants to hear others’ opinions about their work so far can say, “I’m open to 4’s.”)
 
Save helpful ideas and observations from the group in the facilitator guide.
