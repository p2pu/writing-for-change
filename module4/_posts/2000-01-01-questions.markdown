# What is Productive Feedback?

As we dig further into our writing projects, we'll take a step back from our immediate work and take a peek at what everyone else is working on. This week will focus on how we can deliver feedback to inspire and improve our projects. 

This week's readings present a few different feedback models for you to keep in mind as you begin to deliver feedback to your fellow change-makers. A few questions to keep in mind:
- How am I inspiring this person to keep going?
- What other ideas, resources, or people does this project need?
- How would I apply the feedback that I am delivering to my own project?
