# Reflection (5 minutes)

**Plus/Delta** – What went well today? What do you want to change for the next meeting? 
Use the facilitator guide to take notes of any suggestions you want to save.

## Before the Next Meeting

**Independent Assignment:**
It’s time to start the **second draft** of your artifact in a new Google Document! Think through the group’s feedback and incorporate the suggestions that resonated with you into the second draft. We’ll share links to your Google Docs in the facilitator guide during the next session.
