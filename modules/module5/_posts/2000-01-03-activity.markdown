# Activity (25 mins)

Take five minutes to free-write your wildest dreams for your artifact. What speculative future do you envision as a result of your work?

Next, celebrate your progress! Use the rest of the session to reflect on the following questions:

- What impact do you want your artifact to have?
- What further help do you need to get there?
- What help are you able to offer to others on their artifact after the learning circle ends? (This is a great time to trade email addresses with the people youâ€™d like to keep collaborating with!)
