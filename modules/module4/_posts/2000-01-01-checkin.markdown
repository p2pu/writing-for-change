# Check-In (5 minutes)

Last week’s assignment was to start on the first draft of your artifact! Remember - this is just a rough sketch, a way for you to collect your ideas to the following questions. The assignment was to:

- Write a few sentences describing your artifact and how you decided on that intervention
- Collect a list of research links / articles (3-4) and the evidence that supports your intervention
- Find the names and backgrounds of a few experts who you will reach out and talk to

Add your first draft to the facilitator guide! We’ll discuss the group’s drafts later during today’s Activity.
