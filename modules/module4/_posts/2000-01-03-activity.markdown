# Activities (35 mins)

Once everyone has added their responses to the assignment to the facilitator guide, take turns asking for feedback following the steps of the Critical Response Process. Be generous during your critiques - these are still the early stages of the process, and we’re by no means looking for perfection!

As you read each other’s work, keep these questions in mind:
- How am I inspiring this person to keep going?
- What other ideas, resources, or people does this project need?
- How would I apply the feedback that I am delivering to my own project?

Save helpful ideas and observations from the group in the facilitator guide.
