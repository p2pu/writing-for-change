## Reflection (5 minutes)

How did the first meeting go? Take a minute to share something that went well (a “plus”) and something that you’d like to change for next week (a “delta”). 

Make a list of feedback that you want to save in the facilitator guide. You can return to this list during the next meeting to ensure that you’re making changes that benefit the learning experience for everybody.

### Before the Next Meeting
Next week, we’ll discuss how different works of science fiction help us envision and enact change! 

Choose one book, short story, movie, or TV show that envisions change in a way that inspires you. 

Need ideas? Here are some suggestions:
