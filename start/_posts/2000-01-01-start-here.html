<h1>Welcome to Writing for Change</h1>
<p>Thanks for joining this learning circle! Over the course of the next five weeks, the readings and activities in this course will help you to:
- Identify your motivations and desired impact in facilitating change
- Collectively develop interventions that positively impact your communities
- Explore methods that invite iterative collaboration and generative criticism</p>

<p>In the first part of this course, you’ll identify a social issue that matters to you--something that motivates you to enact change. This will prepare you for the next part of the course where you will plan and write for change collectively.
What is freewriting? Freewriting is the process of jotting your thoughts down as quickly as you can without judgment. Every writer struggles with the fear that what they write isn’t “good enough,” and freewriting is a tool that helps you break past that fear and to get something - anything - down on the page.
You and your group can keep track of the writing that you’re doing in your learning circle’s facilitator guide. This will be a living document that all of you can edit to save your assignments, add questions, and leave feedback for future learning circles.</p>

<p>We hope the members of your cohort can support one another long after the conclusion of this learning circle. To the future!</p>
